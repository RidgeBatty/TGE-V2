1. There's no way to really prevent developer from installing his own event handlers. It can be discouraged but don't fight it.

2. Typically games have UI layer which is supposed to be working when the game is paused. This has a couple of implications.
    a)  Works fine if the UI is done using HTML elements as there is no way for the engine to really 'stop' this.
    b)  If the UI is done using Actors, there might be a problem of updating the UI while the gameloop is stopped (game is paused)
        although the mouse events will still work just fine, UI animations which require tick() and update() will not.
