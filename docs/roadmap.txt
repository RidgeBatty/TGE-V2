Development steps
=======================

Next version improvements
=========================

- Add flags register (flags.js) support into Engine, Actor, Gameloop
- Particles: Improvements to particles, clear distinction between Text, Shapes and Images
- Particles: Evolution of angular speed
- Particles: Evolution functions (sine, square and sawtooth waves)
- Particle Editor: add html-ui components
- UI: html-ui serialization/deserialization
- DevTools: plotter, plot editor

Module updates/upgrades
=======================
These upgrades are necessary to modernize the engine and get rid of the remaining HTMLElement based graphics.

    The following modules need to be overhauled/refactored to work in the new V2 system:
        - animation.js
        - raytracer.js
        - texture.js
        - world.js

    UI modules need to be overhauled:
        - dialog.js
        - mainmenu.js

    System wide updates. These modules might need some attention when trying to build a consistent inheritance hierarchy:
        - root.js
        - childActor.js
    


Improved dev tooling
=======================
These upgrades aim in adding visual assist tools in the engine and bring it closer to a level editor.

1. First step is adding analytic, diagnostics and debugging features, which allow starting/stopping the game loop 
and getting information from Actors and the Engine state (on mouse click).
    Status: 20.12.2021 first step is complete

2. Actor editor mode. Create/modify/delete actors in real time. Dump data in developer console.
    Status: 20.12.2021 first step is 30% complete

3. Actor save/load feature

4. Save/load changes to/from 'level' files.
