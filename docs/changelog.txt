Version 2.3
Huge changes made for better support of platformer/tilemap based games, including asset management and level editors
- Added AssetManager
- Added tools/collider-editor
- Improved event system
- Improved flipbook
- Improved world (added concept of Camera)
- New module: renderer (needs more integration work)
- Improved/overhauled/new modules: ui-html, actor, actorMovement, collider, customLayer, engine, enum, gameController, gameLoop, physics, player, tileMap, type
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.2
- Reworked HTML UI system and UI components
- Reworked engine module event handling (added events.js) currently the event system is still a bit of a mess 
- Added tileMap and customLayer, which will be a replacement for World and Scene modules. World cannot be destoroyed yet because it has the code for the isometric renderer
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.1
- Major upgrades and fixes in GameLoop, Actor and Collider classes to improve collisions, collision detection algorithms and timing issues
- Added collisionOptimizer, although not complete yet, allows for much more granular control of collision detection in the future by using quadtrees
- Added Experimental sub-folder for saving tests of upcoming/experimental features as part of the engine
- Three.js and rasterizer.js allow mathematically accurate software rendering of basic meshes (incomplete, but somewhat usable)
- Server-side sub-folder added, which contains files for upcoming server side TGE compiler/interpreter which allows saving permanent game state and possibly multiplayer games in the future
- Improved/updated raytracer.js and added a new demo (raytracer)
- Added Engine.setup function which takes several common setup parameters/flags at once
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.11
- Relaxation of ParticleSystem.Emitter parameters. InitEmitter does not seal the params object any more
- Fixed a bug which prevented images from being added into particles via "params.initParticle.img" parameter
- Fixed bugs in Audio.js and added pause() method

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.10
- Fixed async image loading problem in _initEmitter() by moving the image loading as last executed thing

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.9
- Added Particle-Score demo
- Improved particle system
- Fixed bug in layers.js where renderingSurface transform was not reset before drawing the image

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.8
- Fixed: Audio SFX now returns a promise

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.7

- Fixed Types.Color color conversion process from CSS color values to native Type.Color 
- Improved particles.js (breaking changes)
- Particles no longer modify params object. Instead, it creates local copies of the params properties.
- To further make particle systems more robust and avoid problems with typos in property names, emitter instances are no longer extendable. 
- If you need to add custom properties to emitters, use emitter.data object which will be ignored by the particle engine.
- Multiple ParticleSystem instances can now be created. The engine maintains of list of all instances (Engine.gameLoop.particleSystems array)
- Fixed particle system gravity
- Added particle system gravity example
- Audio subsystem update
- Audio demo added

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.6

- Added particle system editor (devtools)
- Improved audio.js documentation
- Improved actor rendering
- flags.js finalized (sort of)
- Improved particles.js
- Added gameLoop.step()
- Added preventKeyDefaults flag and preventedKeys object into Engine class

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.5

- Added basic shapes in particle engine: circle, square, ring, triangle, polygon, star
- Added particle image and shape tinting, particle shape tint evolution
- Added emitter.pivot (Vector2) to allow the spawn point to be moved at will
- Added particle scale evolution
- Added Actor.opacity. 1 = fully opaque (default), 0 = transparent
- Added Gameloop.clearColor property (null i.e. disabled by default) 
- Improved html-ui.js module functionality and added UWindow and UListbox components
- Some improvements to DevTools and UI event handling pipeline (event delegation not working well with MultiCast)
- Improvements and bug fixes in Types.Color class
- Reworked actor creation in GameLoop.add()
- Separated Actors from other Gameloop Objects (Layer, Level, Custom)
- Slightly improved Actor rendering speed
- Added mixin support (utils.js)
- Added ImageOwner mixin into Actor and Layer classes
- Separated Parallax and Layer into own different classes. Layer can now be used to represent lightweight, scrollable background image instead of an actor
- Examples overhauled
- Added actor-stress-test, actor-target, and particles2 examples

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.4

- Improved documentation
- Fixed bugs in Actor, Colliders, collision detection, Projectiles, GameLoop
- Added/Improved Projectile Actor homing parameters and behavior
- Added Actor.addCollider() convenience function
- Added Enemy Actor
- Automatic collision handling between Player, PlayerShot, Enemy, EnemyShot. Create the Actors, attach Colliders and go!
- Added html-ui.js module with basic UI components
- Added some UI components in DevTools
- Improved MultiCast functionality and performance. Event delegate arrays are now created on-demand.
- Implemented Engine.flags.mouseEnabled to allow disabling of Engine mouse events
- Fixed missing implementation of PointerController.isActive 
- Vastly improved particle engine
- Rewritten examples/particles demo 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
